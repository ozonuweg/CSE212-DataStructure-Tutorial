# Queue

Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. This means that with a queue, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.


## Enqueue
This is a function that adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)

## Dequeue
This function removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed or added (FIFO). If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)
