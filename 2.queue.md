# Queue

Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. This means that with a queue, the least recently added item is removed first. A good example of queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.


## Enqueue
This is an operation that adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)\
Python Code to implement this: my_queue.append(value)

## Dequeue
This operation removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed or added (FIFO). If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition – Time Complexity : O(1)\
Python Code to implement this:\ 
value = my_queue[0]\
del my_queue[0]\
or\
value = my_queue.pop(0)

## Queues in Python
Queue is built-in module of Python which is used to implement a queue.
There are various functions available in this module: 
 
- maxsize – Number of items allowed in the queue.
- empty() – Return True if the queue is empty, False otherwise.
- full() – Return True if there are maxsize items in the queue. If the queue was initialized with maxsize=0 (the default), - then full() never returns True.
- get() – Remove and return an item from the queue. If queue is empty, wait until an item is available.
- get_nowait() – Return an item if one is immediately available, else raise QueueEmpty.
- put(item) – Put an item into the queue. If the queue is full, wait until a free slot is available before adding the item.
- put_nowait(item) – Put an item into the queue without blocking. If no free slot is immediately available, raise QueueFull.
- qsize() – Return the number of items in the queue.
